Machine Learning Analysis of Protein Function Prediction
===========

Our final project for INFO-B529. This project aims to determine the function of a protein using only the primary sequence.

SYNOPSIS
-------------------

The repository includes both the original dataset, the C++ script to calculate the protein characteristics, and the WEKA files.
